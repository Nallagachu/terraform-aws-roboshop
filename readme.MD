# üèóÔ∏è Terraform Module: AWS Three-Tier Infrastructure for RoboShop

[](https://www.terraform.io/)

[](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

> A **reusable Terraform module** designed to provision a complete, scalable, and secure **three-tier infrastructure** on AWS, purpose-built for the **RoboShop** e-commerce application.

-----

## üìå Purpose & Value Proposition

This module is the foundational layer for deploying the RoboShop application on AWS. It provisions the necessary cloud infrastructure across web, application, and database tiers, enabling:

  * **Modular Infrastructure Deployment:** Acts as a **drop-in dependency** for orchestrating complex RoboShop infrastructure pipelines, promoting clean separation of concerns.
  * **Accelerated Development:** Serves as a **production-ready reference module** for building or deploying similar 3-tier cloud architectures quickly and consistently.
  * **Full-Stack IaC Integration:** Seamlessly integrates into a comprehensive Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configuration management workflow (Terraform + Ansible).

-----

## üß± Architecture Overview

This module provisions the core components of a classic three-tier web application architecture, ensuring scalability, security, and separation of concerns:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client] --> B(Application Load Balancer<br>(Web Tier))
    B --> C{EC2 Instances<br>(Application Tier)}
    C --> D[RDS / DocumentDB / ElastiCache<br>(Database Tier)]

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#fbb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

  * **Web Tier:** Handled by the Application Load Balancer (ALB), routing traffic to the application servers.
  * **Application Tier:** Consists of EC2 instances running various RoboShop microservices (e.g., Catalogue, User, Cart, Payment).
  * **Database Tier:** Managed RDS instances providing persistent storage (MySQL, MongoDB, Redis).

-----

## üîó Dependency Usage

This module is specifically designed to be **consumed by** higher-level orchestration repositories. It provides the core infrastructure that other components build upon:

1.  **[roboshop-Infra-dev](https://github.com/Nallagachu/roboshop-Infra-dev)**:
      * This is the main infrastructure orchestrator that calls *this* module to provision AWS resources. It then proceeds to configure application services using Ansible.
2.  **[ansible-roboshop-roles-tf](https://github.com/Nallagachu/ansible-roboshop-roles-tf)**:
      * This module provisions a dedicated Ansible controller. This controller is then used to run playbooks on the EC2 instances provisioned by *this* `terraform-aws-roboshop` module.

-----

## üöÄ Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following set up:

  * **AWS Account:** With sufficient permissions to create EC2, RDS, ALB, and Security Group resources.
  * **Terraform CLI:** Version `1.0.0` or higher installed locally.
  * **AWS CLI:** Configured with your AWS credentials.
  * **Existing VPC & Subnets:** This module deploys resources into an existing network; it does *not* create the VPC or subnets itself.
  * **EC2 Key Pair:** An SSH key pair uploaded to your target AWS region for secure access to EC2 instances.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

This module provides the essential, pre-configured building blocks for your RoboShop application's backend:

  * **Network Integration:** Seamlessly deploys all resources within your existing VPC and specified subnet topology.
  * **Dedicated Application EC2s:** Provisions EC2 instances optimized for various app-tier components (e.g., Catalogue, User, Cart, Payment services).
  * **Managed Database Services:** Sets up robust AWS RDS instances for your database layer, supporting MySQL, PostgreSQL, and providing pathways for MongoDB (via DocumentDB/EC2) and Redis (via ElastiCache/EC2).
  * **Layered Security:** Configures granular Security Groups to control network traffic flow, enhancing the security posture of each tier.
  * **Traffic Distribution:** Integrates Application Load Balancers (ALBs) to efficiently distribute incoming traffic across your application instances.
  * **Actionable Outputs:** Generates crucial outputs like ALB DNS names, EC2 instance IPs, and database endpoints for easy integration with configuration management or other services.

## üöÄ Example Usage

This module is typically invoked from a higher-level orchestrating Terraform project (e.g., `roboshop-Infra-dev`).

```hcl
# main.tf in your orchestrating project (e.g., roboshop-Infra-dev)

# Assuming you have a VPC module defined elsewhere and its outputs available
# module "vpc_network" {
#   source = "..."
# }

module "roboshop_aws_infrastructure" {
  source               = "github.com/Nallagachu/terraform-aws-roboshop" # Recommended: Use a specific Git ref or tag for production
  
  env                  = "dev"
  vpc_id               = module.vpc_network.vpc_id # Replace with your VPC module's output
  subnet_ids           = module.vpc_network.public_subnet_ids # Replace with your public subnets

  instance_type        = "t3.medium"
  db_instance_class    = "db.t3.medium"
  db_engine            = "mysql"
  db_name              = "roboshop"
  db_user              = "admin"
  db_password          = var.db_password # Best practice: Use a `var` and provide via TF_VARs or .tfvars file

  key_name             = "my-roboshop-ssh-key" # Ensure this key exists in your AWS account
  app_port             = 8080
  lb_port              = 80
}

# Example of consuming module outputs for subsequent steps (e.g., Ansible inventory)
output "application_server_ips" {
  description = "Public IPs of the RoboShop application EC2 instances."
  value       = module.roboshop_aws_infrastructure.app_public_ips
}

output "database_connection_endpoint" {
  description = "Connection endpoint for the RoboShop database."
  value       = module.roboshop_aws_infrastructure.db_endpoint
  sensitive   = true # Mark as sensitive if it contains credentials or should not be printed in logs
}

output "web_frontend_url" {
  description = "The DNS name of the Application Load Balancer to access the RoboShop application."
  value       = "http://${module.roboshop_aws_infrastructure.alb_dns_name}"
}
```

## üß© End-to-End Workflow: IaC to Application

This module is a critical piece in a holistic DevOps workflow, enabling automated infrastructure provisioning and application configuration:

### 1\. **Provision Foundational Infrastructure (Terraform)**

  * **Action:** Execute `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply` from your orchestrating project (e.g., `roboshop-Infra-dev`).
  * **Outcome:** This `terraform-aws-roboshop` module provisions all core AWS resources: EC2 instances for the application tier, RDS databases, Application Load Balancers, and necessary Security Groups, ready for application deployment.

### 2\. **Automate Application Configuration (Ansible)**

  * **Action:** The orchestrating project (or a dedicated CI/CD pipeline) leverages the outputs from this Terraform module to dynamically build an Ansible inventory.
  * **Integration:** The `ansible-roboshop-roles-tf` module can provision an Ansible controller if needed. Ansible playbooks (from your `roboshop-ansible` repository) are then executed on the newly provisioned EC2 instances, configuring the application components (e.g., installing software, setting up services, configuring database connections).

### 3\. **Deploy & Validate RoboShop Application**

  * **Action:** With infrastructure provisioned and applications configured, the RoboShop backend services become operational.
  * **Outcome:** The application is accessible via the ALB's DNS name, and all microservices communicate seamlessly within the established three-tier architecture.
